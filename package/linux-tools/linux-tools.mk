# Note: our package infrastructure uses the full-path of the last-scanned

# like below, before we call one of the *-package macro is usally not
# working.
# However, since the files we include here are in the same directory as
# the current Makefile, we are OK. But this is a hard requirement: files
# included here *must* be in the same directory!
